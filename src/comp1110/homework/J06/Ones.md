Within the `comp1110.homework.J06` package of the `comp1110-homework` project,
create a class `Ones` that reads from the console a positive integer and prints
out the number of '1's in the underlining binary pattern representation. This
program need only work with positive numbers. e.g. The integer 5 has 2 '1's its
binary representation, so you would print out `2`. Test your solution using the
`J06` test.

Once you have it working, add and commit your work.
