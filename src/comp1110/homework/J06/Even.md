Within the `comp1110.homework.J06` package of the `comp1110-homework` project,
create a class `Even` that reads an integer (`n`) from the console and then
prints all the even numbers between 1 and n, inclusive of n, each on a new line.
Test your solution using the `J06` test.

Once you have it working, add and commit your work.
