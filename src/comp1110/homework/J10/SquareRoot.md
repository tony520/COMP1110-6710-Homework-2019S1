Within the `comp1110.homework.J10` package of the `comp1110-homework` project,
create a class `SquareRoot` that implements the method `public static String findPreciseRoot(int n, int d)`.
Given a number `n`, your task is to find its square root with an accuracy of `d` decimal points.
If the number is a perfect square, return only the integer part. `e.g.` if `n = 16` & `d = 2`, output should be `4` and 
`not 4.00`


You can write a main method to test your code, if you may wish to.


`Note:` Since square root is not defined for negative numbers therefore your program should simply print `-1`

    Sample Input 1               Sample Output 1
    19 4                         4.3589
    
     
    Sample Input 2               Sample Output 2
    25 2                         5

    
    Sample Input 3               Sample Output 3
    -10 0                        -1

Test your solution using the `J10` test.

Once you have it working, add and commit your work.
