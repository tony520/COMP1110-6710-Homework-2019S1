Within the `comp1110.homework.J05` package of the `comp1110-homework` project,
create a class `Movie` that reads in the name of a movie and its length in minutes,
entered one line after the other at the console. The program must print the name
of the film followed by `runs for `, then its length in hours and minutes, followed by a newline character.
e.g. if the inputs are `Finding Nemo` and `104`, then the program would output
`Finding Nemo runs for 1 hour and 44 minutes`. If the movie is less than one hour,
you should not print hours, if it is greater than one hour you should print
`hours` instead of `hour`. Likewise for minutes; if there are no minutes,
do not print them, if there is one, print `minute`, and if more than one, print
`minutes`. (Hint - use the `%` operator). Test your solution using the
`J05` test.

Once you have it working, add and commit your work.
