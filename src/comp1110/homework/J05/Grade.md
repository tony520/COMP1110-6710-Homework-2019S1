Within the `comp1110.homework.J05` package of the `comp1110-homework` project,
create a class `Grade` that reads a mark for a subject (an integer) from the
console and then prints the final grade based on this mark. Assume final
grades are calculated using the following: marks between and including 0
and 49 will given a grade of `N`, 50 and 59 will give `P`, 60 and 69 will
give `C`, 70 and 79 will give `D`, and finally 80 and 100 will give `HD`.
If the mark is less than zero or greater than 100, print `Bad mark`.
Test your solution using the `J05` test.

 Once you have it working, add and commit your work.
