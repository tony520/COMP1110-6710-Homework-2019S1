Within the `comp1110.homework.J05` package of the `comp1110-homework` project,
create a class `Odd` that reads an integer from the console and then determines
whether it is odd. If the input is a number, X, the program will print `X is odd`.
if X is odd, otherwise it will print `X is even`. For exanple, if the number was 3,
the program would print `3 is odd`. This program must use a method with the
signature `public static boolean isOdd(int i)`. Test your solution using the
`J05` test.

Once you have it working, add and commit your work.
