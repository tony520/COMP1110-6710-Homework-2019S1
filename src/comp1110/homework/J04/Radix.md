Within the `comp1110.homework.J04` package of the `comp1110-homework` project,
create a class `Radix` that is able to convert numbers between
different radices (also known as bases) (for simplicity we
restrict the possible radices to 2, 3, 4, ... , 16). The
program should read in three variables from the console one
line after another; an integer, the source base, an integer,
the destination base, and a string. The program should
interpret the string as a number in source base and output
 it as a number in destination base (using the source and
 destination base number system). e.g. Say your source base
 was 3 and the destination base was 5. Then if the string
 was 21, then `12` should be printed. You do not need to
 handle negative numbers. Test your solution using the
 `J04` test.


 Once you have it working, add and commit your work.
