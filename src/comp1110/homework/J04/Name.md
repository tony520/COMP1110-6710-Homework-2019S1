Within the `comp1110.homework.J04` package of the `comp1110-homework` project,
create a class `Name` that reads in your name from the console
and then prints out your name in upper case (hint: use the
`toUpperCase()` method of `String`), and then on a new line,
print the number of characters in your name. e.g. if your
name is Bill the program should print out `BILL` on one line
and `4` on the next. Test your solution using the `J04`
test.

Once you have it working, add and commit your work.
