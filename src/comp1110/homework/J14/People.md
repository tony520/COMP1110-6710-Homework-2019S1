Within the `comp1110.homework.J14` package of the `comp1110-homework` project,
create a class `People` that will store a table of people's first names and ages
(using a `HashMap`, the people's names as the key, and integer ages as the value).
Read people and ages from the console (e.g. `Bob 19`) and add to the `HashMap`.
For this example, assume ages are integers and names do not contain spaces. After
a list of name, age pairs, a name will be entered without an age (e.g. `Mary`) and
the user will terminate their input by typing `ctrl-D`, by pressing the control and
'D' keys (`ctrl-Z` on Windows).  Treat the last name (`Mary` in this example) as a
query.  Print out the age of the person entered last, or print `unknown` if the
person's name is unknown (i.e. it did not appear earlier in the list).

Once you have it working, add and commit your work.
