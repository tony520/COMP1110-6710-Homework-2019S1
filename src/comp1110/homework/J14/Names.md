Within the `comp1110.homework.J14` package of the `comp1110-homework` project,
create a class `Names` that will create an `ArrayList` of `String`, read names
from the console into it, each on a separate line (until the user indicates the
end of the list by typing `ctrl-D`, by pressing the control and `D` keys,
(`ctrl-Z` on Windows)), and print the names out in reverse order on separate lines
(using a `for` loop ).

Once you have it working, add and commit your work.
