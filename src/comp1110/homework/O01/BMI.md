Within the `comp1110.homework.O01` package of the `comp1110-homework` project,
create a class `BMI` that stores information about a person including: name,
height, and weight.
* The class will have a constructor `BMI(String name, double height,
double weight)`.
* The class should have a public instance method, `getBMI()` that returns a `double` reflecting the person's BMI (Body Mass Index = weight (kg) / height^2 (m2) ).
* The class should have a public `toString()` method that returns a `String` like `Fred is 1.9m tall and is 87.0Kg and has a BMI of 24.099722991689752Kg/m^2` (just print the `double`s without special formatting).
* Implement this class (if you wish you may implement a main method that demonstrates its use).

Once you have it working, add and commit your work.
